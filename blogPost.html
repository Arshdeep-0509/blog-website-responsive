            If you’ve studied computer science, you will have gained many technical and non-technical skills which are
            highly valued by employers, from leadership to programming. The increasing scope of computer science means
            you have plenty of choice in a wide variety of highly specialized areas.

        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            Computer technologies are integral to modern life, so you’re likely to find your computer science skills in
            high demand across many different industries. These include financial organizations, management consultancy
            firms, software houses, communications companies, data warehouses, multinational companies, governmental
            agencies, universities and hospitals.

        </p>

        <p class="font1">
            As always, it’s extremely beneficial to have completed relevant work experience. You should also consider
            compiling a portfolio of your own independent projects outside of your degree, which could be in the form of
            programming, moderating online or even building an app. This will demonstrate to employers your interest in
            the subject and your problem-solving skills, creativity and initiative.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
        <h2><b><i>IT Consultant</i></b></h2>

        <div>
            <img src="img/itc.jpg" width="300px" height="350px" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="font1">

            Working in partnership with clients, an IT consultant advises clients on the planning, design,
            installation and usage of information technology systems to meet their business objectives, overcome
            problems or improve the structure and efficiency of their IT systems.

        </p>

        <p class="font1">
            As you represent a broad role in IT, your job will be similar to that of systems analysts, systems
            designers and applications programmers, whose roles are more specialized but nonetheless work on a
            consultancy basis.

        </p>

        <p class="font1">

            You may also become involved in sales and business development, identifying potential clients and
            maintaining good business contacts. There is fierce competition in this role, so gaining work experience
            in
            a commercial environment would help increase your prospects.
        </p>

        <p class="font1">

            Depending on what computer science specializations you studied during your degree, you may wish to
            specialize as a cybersecurity consultant or an information security specialist. Maintaining cyber
            security has become increasingly important, so in this role you will focus on understanding the risks to
            the security of information or data.

        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            You’ll analyze where security breaches may occur or have occurred, and restore or reinforce systems
            against such breaches, to ensure that confidential data is protected. This role could include ‘ethical
            hacking’, meaning deliberately attempting to hack into your employer’s network to expose any weaknesses.
            Alternatively, you could work as a computer forensics analyst or investigator to combat the increasing
            phenomenon of cyber-crime.
        </p>

        <p class="font1">
        <h2><b><i>Information Systems Manager</i></b></h2>
        <div>
            <img src="img/ism.jpg" width="300px" height="350px" alt="">
        </div>

        <p class="font1">

            A similar role to an IT consultant, an information systems manager is usually a full-time member of staff,
            responsible for the secure and effective operation of computer systems within their company. You’ll be
            responsible (perhaps with the help of a team of IT staff) for the entire upkeep of the ICT infrastructure
            within your organization, with typical tasks involving the overseeing of system installation; ensuring
            systems are backed-up and that the back-up systems are operating effectively; purchasing hardware and
            software; setting up secure access for all users; ensuring security of data from internal and external
            attack; and providing IT support and advice for the users.
        </p>

        <p class="font1">
            You’ll need to make sure the ICT facilities meet the needs of your company and are current, while remaining
            within a set budget, and within all relevant software licensing laws. You may also need an understanding of
            business and management principles in order to contribute to organizational policy regarding quality
            standards and strategic planning in relation to IT.
